ComicShelf
==========

ComicShelf is a QML-based webcomic-reader for the Ubuntu Mobile operating system. ComicShelf is distributed under the MIT-lisence and it is Free And Open Source Software. ComicShelf is still in heavy developement, so it is likely to change.

ComicShelf 0.9

Features
--------

ComicShelf only supports a limited set of comics right now, but I will soon add more. The following ones are available:

 - [Twokinds](http://twokinds.keenspot.com/ "Twokinds") by Thomas Fischbach
 - [Freefall](http://freefall.purrsia.com/ "Freefall") by Mark Stanley
 - [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/, "xkcd") by Randall Munroe

If you know a good comic that you wold want to integrate, please tell me (see below). Please keep in mind, that either the lisence of the comic must allow me to integrate it, or an agreement can be done with the comics author.

###Later I may:

 - Add cache support for letting the user download comics once and read them later
 - Port the app to other platforms
 - Add a store / library funtion to manage comics (Though only when they will be in suffiescent quantity to justify taking such an action)
 - Translate the app to other languages

Contact Me
----------

If you have something to say about the app, found a bug, want me to integrate some comic, or are a comic artist yourself, feel free to contact me. The most practical way to reach me is to email me at [theo.friberg@gmail.com](mailto:theo.friberg@gmail.com "Contact Me"). I would be glad to hear feedback for my apps.
